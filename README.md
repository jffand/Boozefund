Boozefund is a web application that allows you to manage, vote on, and buy spirts for a liquor cabinet that friends can share to host events, meetups, or whatever you like.

Boozefund is still under development. See the work in progress [here](http://ec2-54-187-118-89.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/login)
